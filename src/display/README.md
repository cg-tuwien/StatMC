# Display Extension for pbrt-v3 by Hiroyuki Sakai

This code enables support for the [tev image viewer](https://github.com/Tom94/tev).
It is heavily based on code from [pbrt-v4](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4) (commit `2701ba602261a6c9221fa1c35d5d83660aae3bd0`), which natively supports tev.
To avoid collisions, the code is namespaced as pbrtv4.
